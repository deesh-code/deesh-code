### Software Engineer & Open Source Contributor

*Crafting thoughtful solutions to complex problems*

</div>

<br>

## Philosophy

I believe in the power of well-designed systems and the importance of developer experience. My approach combines technical precision with human-centered design, creating tools and solutions that are both powerful and intuitive.

## Current Work

**Language Design** â€” Contributing to the [Mangle language](https://github.com/google/mangle) with enhanced aggregation syntax and interactive documentation systems

**Developer Tooling** â€” Building automation and documentation tools that improve the development workflow

**Open Source** â€” Maintaining various utilities and contributing to projects that enhance the broader developer ecosystem

## Technical Approach

```python
def solve_problem(challenge):
    """My approach to software engineering"""
    return (
        understand_context(challenge) +
        design_elegant_solution() +
        implement_with_precision() +
        iterate_based_on_feedback()
    )
```

**Primary Technologies:** Python, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript  
**Architecture & Infrastructure:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform  
**Specializations:** Language Design, Documentation Systems, Developer Experience

## Selected Projects

**ðŸš‚ [Grammar Railroad Diagrams](https://github.com/google/mangle/pull/76)**  
Built automated EBNF conversion and interactive visualization system for programming language grammars. Addressed long-standing community request with comprehensive documentation generation.

**âš¡ [Enhanced Aggregation Syntax](https://github.com/google/mangle/pull/75)**  
Designed and implemented expressive aggregation operations following functional programming principles. Maintained backward compatibility while significantly improving developer ergonomics.

## Interests

- **Language Design** â€” Creating expressive, intuitive programming languages
